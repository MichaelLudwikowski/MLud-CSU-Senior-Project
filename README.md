# Stock Trading AI Analyst

A stock trading simulation that uses fake money to mimic the market to get first-time traders more familiar with the stock market without fear of losing money. This program will incorporate AI that can analyze and speculate based on current trading analytics to make a prediction of which stock may rise and fall in price. Additionally, the AI could potentially be used to create simulated investments when it sees a good opportunity to invest. 

## Compile/Deploy

This program will be compiled using primarily tools such as C++, Python, and Java. Development tools such as VS code will be the primary integrated development environment. 

## Usage

The program will primarily serve as a learning tool for people wanting to learn how to invest and better understand stock trading in a risk-free environment. Users can interact with the program telling it when to invest and how much while using the AI's speculations to potentially help in the decision. 

## Options

Simulate stock trading with fake money that mirrors actual real-life trading and market conditions that have occurred already.

Allow the AI to autonomously identify and try to predict the outcome of a current stock based on it's history.

Provide users with a better understanding about stocks as whole.

## Testing

Simulated scenarios to train the AI and hone it's predictive capabilities.

User trials to see how easy it is to use and understand the program.

Debugging and Fuzzer testing to refine performance and eliminate potential errors in the program.
