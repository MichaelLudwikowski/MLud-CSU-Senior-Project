Problem Statement
-----------------

Many people try getting into stock trading with no idea what they are doing. This leads to people investing money and then loosing it without knowing why.


Project Description
-------------------

Create a program that can simulate stock trading with fake money to simulate real trading in real time. Implament an AI that can speculate current trading
prospects in what stocks may rise or lower in price. The AI could then possible invest for you when it sees a great stock to invest in.


Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

C++
Python
Java

Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLLama v3.3

Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------

My Laptop, VSCode (e.g., your IDE).

Personal Motivation
-------------------

I tried teaching myself to invest, but it did not go well. I am trying to make a software to teach people the basics in a safe learning environment that could
motivate and encourage further learning.

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

(What do you need to learn or figure out to complete this project? What tasks are you going to do the do that?)
Learn to use and utilize AI, specifically OLLama. Make sure I know about stock strading as well to not put in misinformation.
Learn to pull in live information for the AI.
